              COMPONENTS PICTURE- colonies, fleets, resources, etc.  Or include w/ individual description below

#### *Resource Cards*

Resource cards represent 3 types of resources ‚Äì üçê Food, üíé Matter, and ‚öõ Energy.  Resources are used to build colonies, fleets, and research technology. At any point in the game, you may spend 4 of a single type of resource in place of another resource.


#### *Tiles*

##### Planet Tiles
Planets with resource symbols are able to produce resources.  Planets with the military symbol allow you to build and upgrade fleets.  Some planets have multiple symbols, and can provide all benefits.
##### Destroyed Planet Tiles
The backs of the planet tiles represent destroyed planets.
##### Empty Tiles
Tiles without planets or symbols represent explored, but empty, space.


#### *Colonies* 

Colonies may only be built on planet tiles.   Colonies represent planets that are part of your civilization.


#### *Fleets*

Fleets represent your military force.  They move throughout space to attack your opponents and to explore.  They are also used defensively.

#### *Technologies*

Technologies represent advancements available to you.  Higher level technologies typically have prerequisites of the lower level technologies, as indicated by the arrows on your role card.  Some technologies are exclusive- meaning you cannot concurrently use both.

## Setup
Each player chooses a role (see [Roles](#roles)) and gets the associated starting tiles.  Each role starts with a different number of colonies, fleets, resources, or technologies, as indicated on the role card.

Players set up their starting pieces in the purple starting zones. Draw 1 of each resource. Your resources are kept in front of you as public information.

## Roles

*Collector*

During setup, place a level one colony and a level one fleet.  You also draw 2 additional resource cards of your choice.
When you harvest, you may gain one bonus resource of your choice, matching one you are able to produce.

*Generalist*

During setup, place a level one colony and a level one fleet.
Instead of 1 base, 1 research, and 1 action of your choice, you may take your 3 actions in any combination you choose.

*Imperialist*

During setup, place a level one colony and two level one fleets.
When any player builds/upgrades a fleet, you may gain a resource of your choice. If this is on your turn, you must be able to afford the fleet before gaining this resource.

*Pioneer*

During setup, place two level one colonies and a level one fleet.
When you build/upgrade a colony on a resource tile, you may gain a resource matching that of the tile. If you build/upgrade on a hybrid tile, you may choose which resource you gain. You must be able to afford the colony before gaining this resource.

*Scientist*

During setup, place a level one **colony** and a level one **fleet**.  You also select a level one technology.
When any player researches a technology, you may gain a **resource** matching one from the cost.

*Warlord*

During setup, place a level one **colony** and a level two **fleet**.
Once per turn, when you **move** a **fleet**, you may gain **resources** matching the tiles of which you enter. You must be able to afford the **move** before gaining the **resources**. You may only gain a **resource** once per tile per **move** action.

## Phases

Phase 1: Bidding

In this phase players bid their resources to claim exploration rights.  At the beginning of your turn, draw and reveal a tile from the bag.  
Each player secretly decides how many resources they are willing to pay, and holds that many colonies in their hand.  All players reveal their bids simultaneously.  The player with the highest bid wins and pays you the second highest bid (known as a Vickrey auction).  If you win the bid, pay the bank.   If there is a tie for highest bid, those players roll a die to determine the winner.  In this case, the "second highest" bid is the same.  It is the second highest bid, not second highest price. 
          
          BIDDING EXAMPLE - with tied bid.  Not a picture.  Make it an example thing.

Phase 2: Exploration

In this phase, the winner of the exploration rights chooses where and how to explore space.  The tile must be placed on an unexplored space.  Exploration must be done in the blue zone until there are 3 or fewer blue spaces left unexplored.

The player may choose to place the tile with either side face up.  If the player places a destroyed planet tile, they may collect any resource from the bank.


Phase 3:  Actions

The bulk of your turn will be spent in this phase.  Each turn, you may take 1 base action, 1 research action, and 1 additional action of your choice (Generalist- see Roles).  Finalize all effects from an action before taking your next action. Some technologies cause slight changes in the base actions.

**_Base Actions_**

**_Build Colony/Colonize_** - You may build a level 1 colony on a tile adjacent to another of your colonies, or on a tile occupied by your fleet.  Cost:  1üçê, 1üíé              

**_Upgrade Colony_** - You may upgrade one of your colonies by 1 level, up to level 3. Cost: 1üçê, 1üíé

**_Harvest_** - You collect resources from every colonized planet tile with a resource symbol (1 card per colony level).  If there are multiple resource symbols, you may choose which resources to produce.
        
        **HARVEST PICTURE- hybrid example**

**_Build Fleet_** - You may build a fleet on a colonized planet tile with a miltiary symbol, up to the level of the colony.

**_Upgrade Fleet_** - You may upgrade an existing fleet by 1 level, providing it is on a colonized planet tile with a military symbol.

**_Move Fleet_** - You may move 1 fleet as many explored tiles as you can afford, up to 8 tiles. 

Movement Cost: 

|Fleet Level|Cost|Movement|
|---|---|---|
|1|1 ‚öõ|2 tiles|
|2|1 ‚öõ|1 tile|
|3|2 ‚öõ|1 tile|

You may not pass through destroyed planet tiles.  You may pass through tiles occupied by your fleets, but cannot end the action there.  You may not pass through a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs fleet or colony (see attacking).  Your fleets may occupy the same tile as your colony.  

You may move your fleet into an unexplored space and draw 1 tile to immediately explore it without bidding.  (Note: The outer spaces, indicated by the white zone, may be explored this way at any time. They are not restricted as during the bidding/exploration phases).  If you place a destroyed planet tile, your fleet is immediately destroyed.
 
**_Attacking_**
On your move action, if your fleet enters a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs fleet and/or colony, you attack.
                              
                              ATTACK PICTURE- win & lose example
To win an attack, you must have a higher offensive strength than your opponent's defensive strength (a tie goes to the defender). Fleet and colony strength is equal to their level, plus any modifiers gained from technology.

On a successful attack, you take over by replacing your opponent's colonies with yours.  Their lost colonies go back into their supply.

If a defensive fleet was on the attacked tile, it is destroyed and returned to their supply. 

On a failed attack, your offensive fleet retreats, and is pushed back into the adjacent tile from where it came.  If it cannot retreat into the adjacent tile (i.e., you moved it through an empty tile through Warp Drive Technology or by passing through a tile that is occupied by another one of your fleets), the attacking fleet is destroyed.

**_Supporting:_** 
You may spend 1‚öõ to support per adjacent active fleet.  Supporting fleets add their level to your strength.  You may support on your turn as part of the attack, or spend the required ‚öõ as defense if attacked. Supporting fleets do not move. 
      
      SUPPORT PICTURE- offense & defense

**_Research Actions_**

*Research* - You may research one technology from the tech tree, and indicate this with a marker.  Effects from technologies researched may be used immediately. 

Technologies are a form of advancement in addition to providing points (see Scoring).

Higher level technologies typically have prerequisites of the lower level technologies, as indicated by the arrows on the tech tree.  Technologies in connected boxes are exclusive- meaning you cannot concurrently use both.  If you decide you want to research the other technology in the box, you must remove your marker from the first technology and move it to the new one.

The costs for each technology is indicated by the resource symbols at the beginning of each line, and cost one resource of each type per level.  For example, Fuel Efficiency costs 1 üíé and 1 ‚öõ; Boosters costs 2 üíé and 2 ‚öõ.  Technology costs marked with an asterisk have unique costs.

*Use Tech* - You may use any of the technologies signified with a üî¨.

*Compile* ‚Äì You may collect one **resource** of your choice from the bank.
‚ÄÉ
## Game End

The game end can be triggered one of two ways:
When one player has two or fewer **colonies** remaining, complete the current round, and play one final round.
When the final tile has been explored, complete the current round, and play 2 additional rounds.


**Scoring**

**_Colonies:_** Level 1 **colonies** are worth 3 points; level 2 are worth 5 points; level 3 are worth 6 points.

**_Fleets:_** Worth points equal to its level.

**_Technology:_**  Worth points equal to its level on the tech tree.  

The player with the highest combined score wins.  In the case of a tie, fight to the death to determine the actual winner (lasers are mandatory).
