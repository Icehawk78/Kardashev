# Kardashev Game Rules

#### Asteri Games

## Objective
The Kardashev Scale is a hypothetical method used to measure a civilization's technological advancement based on the amount of energy they can control.   Your objective is to build the most advanced civilization by expanding your territory, researching new technology, and conquering your foes.‚ÄÉ

              COMPONENTS PICTURE- colonies, fleets, resources, etc.  Or include w/ individual description below

#### *Resource Cards*

Resource cards represent 3 types of resources ‚Äì üçê Food, üíé Matter, and ‚öõ Energy.  Resources are used to build colonies, fleets, and research technology. At any point in the game, you may spend 4 of a single type of resource in place of another resource.

#### *Tiles*

##### Planet Tiles
Planets with resource symbols are able to produce resources.  Planets with the military symbol allow you to build and upgrade fleets.  Some planets have multiple symbols, and can provide all benefits.

##### Destroyed Planet Tiles
The backs of the planet tiles represent destroyed planets.

##### Empty Tiles
Tiles without planets or symbols represent explored, but empty, space.

#### *Colonies* 

Colonies may only be built on planet tiles.   Colonies represent planets that are part of your civilization.


#### *Fleets*

Fleets represent your military force.  They move throughout space to attack your opponents and to explore.  They are also used defensively.

#### *Technologies*

[Technologies](/Errata.md/#Technology) represent advancements available to you, some of which are exclusive to you.  Higher level technologies typically have prerequisites of the lower level technologies.  Some technologies are mutually exclusive- meaning you cannot concurrently use both.

## Setup
Each player chooses a role (see [Roles](/Errata.md#Roles)) and gets the associated starting tiles.  Each role starts with a different number of colonies, fleets, resources, or technologies, as indicated on the role card.

Players set up their starting pieces in the purple starting zones. Draw 1 of each resource. Your resources are kept in front of you as public information.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Bidding

In this phase players bid their resources to claim exploration rights.  At the beginning of your turn, draw and reveal a tile from the bag.

Each player secretly decides how many resources they are willing to pay, and holds that many colonies in their hand.  All players reveal their bids simultaneously.  The player with the highest bid wins and pays you the second highest bid (known as a Vickrey auction).  If you win the bid, pay the bank.   If there is a tie for highest bid, those players roll a die to determine the winner.  In this case, the "second highest" bid is the same.  It is the second highest bid, not second highest price. 
          
    On Adama's turn, he draws a tile.
    Han and River each bid 2, and Adama bids 1.
    Han and River each roll a die to break the tied bid.
    Han rolls a 3 and River rolls a 5, so River wins. 
    She pays Adama 2 resources.

### Phase 2: Exploration

In this phase, the winner of the exploration rights chooses where and how to explore space.  The tile must be placed on an unexplored space.  Exploration must be done in the blue zone until there are 3 or fewer blue spaces left unexplored.

The player may choose to place the tile with either side face up.  If the player places a destroyed planet tile, they may collect any resource from the bank.


### Phase 3:  Actions

The bulk of your turn will be spent in this phase.  Each turn, you may take 1 base action, 1 research action, and 1 additional action of your choice (Generalist- see Roles).  Finalize all effects from an action before taking your next action. Some technologies cause slight changes in the base actions.

#### Base Actions

**_Build Colony/Colonize_** - You may build a level 1 colony on a tile adjacent to another of your colonies, or on a tile occupied by your fleet.  Cost:  1üçê, 1üíé              

**_Upgrade Colony_** - You may upgrade one of your colonies by 1 level, up to level 3. Cost: 1üçê, 1üíé

**_Harvest_** - You collect resources from every colonized planet tile with a resource symbol (1 card per colony level).  If there are multiple resource symbols, you may choose which resources to produce.

**_Build Fleet_** - You may build a fleet on a colonized planet tile with a military symbol, up to the level of the colony.

**_Upgrade Fleet_** - You may upgrade an existing fleet by 1 level, providing it is on a colonized planet tile with a military symbol.

**_Move Fleet_** - You may move 1 fleet as many explored tiles as you can afford, up to 8 tiles. 

Movement Cost: 

|Fleet Level|Cost|Movement|
|---|---|---|
|1|1 ‚öõ|2 tiles|
|2|1 ‚öõ|1 tile|
|3|2 ‚öõ|1 tile|

You may not pass through destroyed planet tiles.  You may pass through tiles occupied by your fleets, but cannot end the action there.  You may not pass through a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs fleet or colony (see attacking).  Your fleets may occupy the same tile as your colony.  

<img src="/images/Movement_Example.png" width="500px"/>

You may move your fleet into an unexplored space and draw 1 tile to immediately explore it without bidding.  (Note: The outer spaces, indicated by the white zone, may be explored this way at any time. They are not restricted as during the bidding/exploration phases).  If you place a destroyed planet tile, your fleet is immediately destroyed.
 
**_Attacking_** - 
On your move action, if your fleet enters a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs fleet and/or colony, you attack.
                              
To win an attack, you must have a higher offensive strength than your opponent's defensive strength (a tie goes to the defender). Fleet and colony strength is equal to their level, plus any modifiers gained from technology.

<img src="/images/Attack_Example.png" width="400px"/>

On a successful attack, you take over by replacing your opponent's colonies with yours.  Their lost colonies go back into their supply.  If a defensive fleet was on the attacked tile, it is destroyed and returned to their supply. 

On a failed attack, your offensive fleet retreats, and is pushed back into the adjacent tile from where it came.  If it cannot retreat into the adjacent tile (i.e., you moved it through an unexplored space using technology or by passing through a tile that is occupied by another one of your fleets), the attacking fleet is destroyed.

**_Supporting:_** - 
You may spend 1‚öõ to support per adjacent fleet.  Supporting fleets add their level to your strength.  You may support on your turn as part of the attack, or spend the required ‚öõ as defense if attacked. Supporting fleets do not move.

#### Research Actions

**_Research_** - You may research a technology by paying the associated cost.  Mark your technologies on your role card.  Effects from technologies researched may be used immediately. 

The costs for each technology is indicated by the resource symbols at the beginning of each line, and cost one resource of each type per level.  For example, Fuel Efficiency costs 1 üíé and 1 ‚öõ; Boosters costs 2 üíé and 2 ‚öõ.  Technology costs marked with an asterisk have unique costs.

Some technologies also require you to have researched a prerequisite technology. This is indicated by arrows leading from the earlier technology to the newer one on your role card.

If you choose to research a technology that is mutually exclusive with one you have already researched, you lose the benefits from the older technology and must remove it from your role card. 


**_Use Technology_** - You may use any of the technologies signified with a üî¨.

**_Compile_** ‚Äì You may collect 1 resource of your choice from the bank.

## Game End

The game end can be triggered one of two ways:
When any player has 2 or fewer colonies remaining, complete the current round, and play one final round.
When the final space has been explored, complete the current round, and play 2 additional rounds.


**Scoring**

The player with the highest combined score wins.  In the case of a tie, fight to the death to determine the actual winner (lasers are mandatory).
