              COMPONENTS PICTURE- colonies, fleets, resources, etc.  Or include w/ individual description below

#### *Resource Cards*

Resource cards represent 3 types of resources ‚Äì üçê Food, üíé Matter, and ‚öõ Energy.  Resources are used to build colonies, fleets, and research technology. At any point in the game, you may spend 4 of a single type of resource in place of another resource.


#### *Tiles*

##### Planet Tiles
Planets with resource symbols are able to produce resources.  Planets with the military symbol allow you to build and upgrade fleets.  Some planets have multiple symbols, and can provide all benefits.
##### Destroyed Tiles
The backs of the planet tiles represent destroyed planets.
##### Empty Tiles
Tiles without planets or symbols represent explored, but empty, space.


#### *Colonies* 

Colonies may only be built on planet tiles.   Colonies represent planets that are part of your civilization.


#### *Fleets*

Fleets represent your military force.  They move throughout space to attack your opponents and to explore.  They are also used defensively.
‚ÄÉ
## Setup
Each player chooses a role (see [Roles](#roles)) and gets the associated starting tiles.  Each role starts with a different number of colonies, fleets, resources, or technologies, as indicated on the role card.

Players set up their starting pieces in the purple starting zones. Draw 1 of each **resource**. Your **resources**  are kept in front of you as public information.

## Roles

*Collector*

During setup, place a level one colony and a level one fleet.  You also draw 2 additional **resource** cards of your choice.
When you **harvest**, you may gain one bonus **resource** of your choice, matching one you are able to produce.

*Generalist*

During setup, place a level one **colony** and a level one **fleet**.
Instead of 1 base, 1 research, and 1 action of your choice, you may take your 3 actions in any combination you choose.

*Imperialist*

During setup, place a level one **colony** and two level one **fleets**.
When any player **builds/upgrades** a **fleet**, you may gain a **resource** of your choice. If this is on your turn, you must be able to afford the **fleet** before gaining this **resource**.

*Pioneer*

During setup, place two level one **colonies** and a level one **fleet**.
When you **build/upgrade** a **colony** on a resource tile, you may gain a **resource** matching that of the tile. If you **build/upgrade** on a hybrid tile, you may choose which **resource** you gain. You must be able to afford the **colony** before gaining this **resource**.

*Scientist*

During setup, place a level one **colony** and a level one **fleet**.  You also select a level one technology.
When any player researches a technology, you may gain a **resource** matching one from the cost.

*Warlord*

During setup, place a level one **colony** and a level two **fleet**.
Once per turn, when you **move** a **fleet**, you may gain **resources** matching the tiles of which you enter. You must be able to afford the **move** before gaining the **resources**. You may only gain a **resource** once per tile per **move** action.

## Phases

Phase 1: Bidding

At the beginning of each turn, players will bid via a Vickrey auction to explore space.  Draw and reveal a tile from the bag.  
Each player secretly decides how many resources to bid, and holds that number of colonies in their hand.  All players reveal their bids simultaneously.  If there is a tie for highest bid, those players roll a die to determine the winner.  The winner pays the second highest bid.  (Note, if two players tie for the highest bid, the "second highest" bid is the same.  It is the second highest bid, not second highest price). 
If you win the bid, pay the bank.  If another player wins the bid, they pay you. 
          
          BIDDING EXAMPLE - with tied bid

Phase 2: Exploration

Whoever won the bid chooses where to place the tile on the board.  Initial exploration must be done in the inner tiles, as indicated by the blue background.  Once all but three of the inner tiles have been explored, you may place a tile in any open space.

When you explore a tile, you also have the option to destroy the tile by flipping it face-down before placing it.  You may collect any resource from the bank.  A destroyed tile is impassable to any player.


Phase 3:  Actions

Each turn, you may take one base action, one research action, and one additional action of your choice (Generalist- see Roles).  Finalize all effects from an action before beginning your next. Some technologies cause slight changes in the base actions.

**_Base Actions_**

**_Build Colony/Colonize_** - You may **build** a level 1 **colony** on a tile adjacent to another of your **colonies**, or on a tile occupied by your **fleet**.  Cost:  1üçê, 1üíé              

**_Upgrade Colony_** - You may **upgrade** one of your **colonies** by one level, up to level 3. Cost: 1üçê, 1üíé

**_Harvest_** - You collect **resources** from every resource tile on which you have a **colony** (one card per level).  You may choose which **resources** your hybrid **colonies** produce.
**HARVEST PICTURE- hybrid example**
**_Build/Upgrade Fleet_** - On your military **colony**, you may **build** a **fleet** up to the level of the **colony**, or **upgrade** an existing **fleet** by one level.

**_Move Fleet_** - You may **move** 1 **fleet** as many explored tiles as you can afford, up to 8 tiles.

Movement Cost: 

|Fleet Level|Cost|Movement|
|---|---|---|
|1|1 ‚öõ|2 tiles|
|2|1 ‚öõ|1 tile|
|3|2 ‚öõ|1 tile|

You may pass through tiles occupied by your **fleets**, but cannot end the action there.  You may not pass through a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs **fleet** or **colony** tile (see attacking).  Your **fleets** may occupy the same tile as your **colony**.

You may **move** your **fleet** into an unexplored space and draw one tile to immediately explore it without bidding.  (Note: The outer tiles, indicated with the white background, may be explored this way at any time. They are not restricted as during the bidding/exploration phases).  If you choose to destroy this tile, your **fleet** is immediately destroyed.
 
**_Attacking_**
On your **move** action, if your **fleet** enters a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs **fleet** and/or **colony**, you attack.
                              
                              ATTACK PICTURE- win & lose example
To win an attack, you must have a higher offensive strength than their defensive strength (a tie goes to the defender). **Fleet** and **colony** strength is equal to their level, plus any modifiers gained from technology.

**_Supporting:_** 
You may spend 1‚öõ to support per adjacent active **fleet**.  Supports add their level to your strength.  You may support on your turn as part of the attack, or spend the required ‚öõ as defense if attacked. Supporting **fleets** do not move tiles. 

On a successful attack, you take over by replacing their **colonies** with yours.  Their lost **colonies** go back into their supply.

If a defensive **fleet** was on the attacked tile, it is destroyed and returned to their supply. 

On a failed attack, your offensive **fleet** retreats, and is pushed back into the adjacent tile from where it came.  If it cannot retreat into the adjacent tile (i.e., you moved it through an empty tile through Warp Drive Technology or by passing through a tile that is occupied by another one of your **fleets**), the attacking **fleet** is destroyed.

      SUPPORT PICTURE- offense & defense

**_Research Actions_**

*Research* - You may research one technology from the tech tree, and indicate this with a marker.  Effects from technologies researched may be used immediately. 

Technologies are a form of advancement in addition to providing points (see Scoring).

Higher level technologies typically have prerequisites of the lower level technologies, as indicated by the arrows on the tech tree.  Technologies in connected boxes are exclusive- meaning you cannot concurrently use both.  If you decide you want to research the other technology in the box, you must remove your marker from the first technology and move it to the new one.

The costs for each technology is indicated by the resource symbols at the beginning of each line, and cost one resource of each type per level.  For example, Fuel Efficiency costs 1 üíé and 1 ‚öõ; Boosters costs 2 üíé and 2 ‚öõ.  Technology costs marked with an asterisk have unique costs.

*Use Tech* - You may use any of the technologies signified with a üî¨.

*Compile* ‚Äì You may collect one **resource** of your choice from the bank.
‚ÄÉ
## Game End

The game end can be triggered one of two ways:
When one player has two or fewer **colonies** remaining, complete the current round, and play one final round.
When the final tile has been explored, complete the current round, and play 2 additional rounds.


**Scoring**

**_Colonies:_** Level 1 **colonies** are worth 3 points; level 2 are worth 5 points; level 3 are worth 6 points.

**_Fleets:_** Worth points equal to its level.

**_Technology:_**  Worth points equal to its level on the tech tree.  

The player with the highest combined score wins.  In the case of a tie, fight to the death to determine the actual winner (lasers are mandatory).
