#### *Resources*

There are three types of resources ‚Äì üçê Food, üíé Matter, and ‚öõ Energy. Resources are used to build colonies, fleets, and research technology. At any point in the game, you may spend 4 of one type of resource in place of another resource.

Colonies built on resource tiles produce resource cards. Colonies built on military tiles allow for building and upgrading of fleets.


#### *Fleets*

Fleets provide defense and the option to attack an opponent‚Äôs tiles, as well as letting you explore.
‚ÄÉ
## Setup
Each player chooses one role (see [Roles](#roles)) and gets the associated starting piece (which includes a home tile and additional starting tile).

Players set up their starting pieces, in turn order. Everyone starts with a level one colony and a level one fleet. Place these on either tile on your starting piece. Draw a üçê and a üíé resource card. Your resource cards are kept face-up in front of you.

## Roles

*Collector*

During setup, you get 2 additional resource cards.
When you harvest, you may gain one bonus resource of your choice, matching one you are able to produce.

*Developer*

During setup, instead of a level one colony on your home tile, you start with a level two colony.
When you upgrade one of your colonies, you may gain a resource matching that of the tile. If you upgrade on a hybrid tile, you may choose which resource you gain. You must be able to afford the colony before gaining this resource.

*Imperialist*

During setup, you place an additional level one fleet from your supply on either of your starting tiles.
When any player builds/upgrades a fleet, you may gain a resource of your choice. If this is on your turn, you must be able to afford the fleet before gaining this resource.

*Pioneer*

During setup, you place an additional level one colony from your supply on either of your starting tiles. 
When you build a colony on a resource tile, you may gain a resource matching that of the tile. If you build on a hybrid tile, you may choose which resource you gain. You must be able to afford the colony before gaining this resource.

*Scientist*

During setup, you begin with a level one technology.
When any other player researches a technology, you may gain a resource matching one from the cost.

*Warlord*

During setup, instead of a level one fleet, you place a level two fleet.
Once per turn, when you move a fleet, you may gain up to 8 resources matching the tiles through which you move. You do not gain resources if you fail an attack and must retreat. You must be able to afford the move before gaining the resources. You may only gain a resource once per tile per move action.

## Actions

Phase 1: Bidding

At the beginning of your turn, you will first bid to explore space.  Draw a tile from the bag.  You start the bidding at 0 resources. Bidding continues clockwise, with each player either raising the bid or passing until only one player remains.  If you win the bid, pay the bank.  If another player wins the bid, they pay you. 

Phase 2: Exploration

Whoever won the bid chooses where to place the tile on the board.  They also have the option to destroy the tile by flipping it face-down before placing it, and may collect any resource from the bank.  A destroyed tile is impassable to any player. 

Phase 3:  Actions

Each turn, you may take two actions and two research actions.  Finalize all effects from an action before beginning your next. Some technologies cause slight changes in the base actions.

**_Build Colony/Colonize_** - You may build a level 1 colony on a tile adjacent to another of your colonies, or on a tile occupied by your fleet.  Cost:  1üçê, 1üíé              

**_Upgrade Colony_** - You may upgrade one of your colonies by one level, up to level 3. Cost: 1üçê, 1üíé

**_Harvest_** - You collect resources from every resource tile on which you have a colony (one card per level).  You may choose which resources your hybrid colonies produce.

**_Build/Upgrade Fleet_** - On your home tile or military colony, you may build a fleet up to the level of the colony, or upgrade an existing fleet by one level. Cost: 1üíé, 1‚öõ per level on your home tile; free on your military colony.

**_Move Fleet_** - You may move 1 fleet as many explored tiles as you can afford.

Movement Cost: 

|Fleet Level|Cost|Movement|
|---|---|---|
|1|1 ‚öõ|2 tiles|
|2|1 ‚öõ|1 tile|
|3|2 ‚öõ|1 tile|

You may pass through tiles occupied by your fleets, but cannot end the action there.  You may not pass through a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs fleet or colony tile (see attacking).  Your fleets may occupy the same tile as your colony.

You may move your fleet into an unexplored space and draw one tile to immediately explore it without bidding.  If you choose to destroy this tile, your fleet is immediately destroyed.
 
**_Attacking_**
On your move action, if your fleet enters a tile occupied by another player‚Äôs fleet and/or colony, you attack.

To win an attack, you must have a higher offensive strength than their defensive strength (a tie goes to the defender).  Fleet and colony strength is equal to their level, plus any modifiers gained from technology.

**_Supporting:_** 
You may spend 1‚öõ to support per adjacent active fleet.  Supports add their level to your strength.  You may support on your turn as part of the attack, or spend the required ‚öõ as defense if attacked. Supporting fleets do not move tiles. 

On a successful attack, you take over by replacing their colonies with yours.  Their lost colonies go back into their supply.

If a defensive fleet was on the attacked tile, it is destroyed and returned to their supply. 

On a failed attack, your offensive fleet retreats, and is pushed back into the adjacent tile from where it came.  If it cannot retreat into the adjacent tile (i.e., you moved it through an empty tile through Warp Drive Technology or by passing through a tile that is occupied by another one of your fleets), the attacking fleet is destroyed.
 
**_Research Actions_**

In addition to your 2 base actions, you have 2 research actions.  You may use these to:
*Research* - You may research one technology from the tech tree, and indicate this with a marker.  Effects from technologies researched may be used immediately. 

Technologies are a form of advancement in addition to providing points (see Scoring).

Higher level technologies typically have prerequisites of the lower level technologies, as indicated by the arrows on the tech tree.  Technologies in the red boxes are exclusive- meaning you cannot concurrently use both.  If you decide you want to research the other technology in the box, you must remove your marker from the first technology and move it to the new one.  

*Use Tech* - You may use any of the technologies signified with a üî¨.

*Compile* ‚Äì You may collect one resource of your choice from the bank.
‚ÄÉ
## Game End

When one player has two or fewer colonies remaining, complete the current round, and play one final round.

**Scoring**

**_Colonies:_** Level 1 colonies are worth 3 points; level 2 are worth 5 points; level 3 are worth 6 points.

**_Fleets:_** Worth points equal to its level.

**_Technology:_**  Worth points equal to its level on the tech tree.  

The player with the highest combined score wins.  In the case of a tie, fight to the death to determine the actual winner (lasers are mandatory).
