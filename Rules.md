#### *Resource Tokens*
Resource tokens represent 3 types of resources ‚Äì üçê Food, üíé Matter, and ‚öõ Energy. Resources are used to build colonies, fleets, and research technology. At any point in the game, you may spend 3 of a single type of resource in place of another resource.
Resources are public information and must be visibly displayed in front of you.

#### *Tiles*  

##### Planet Tiles  
Planets with resource symbols are able to produce resources. Planets with the military symbol allow you to build and upgrade fleets. Some planets have multiple symbols, and can provide all benefits.

##### Destroyed Planet Tiles  
The backs of the planet tiles represent destroyed planets.

<img src="/images/Back.png" width="250px"/>

##### Empty Space Tiles  
Tiles without planets or symbols represent explored, but empty, space. 
 
<img src="/images/Empty_Tile.png" width="250px"/>


#### *Colonies*  
Colonies may only be built on planet tiles. Colonies represent planets that are part of your civilization.

#### *Fleets*
Fleets represent your military force. They move throughout space to attack your opponents and to explore. They are also used defensively.

#### *Technologies*  
Technologies represent advancements available to you, some of which are exclusive to you.  Higher level technologies typically have prerequisites of the lower level technologies.
The greyscale side of the technology card indicates it has not been researched; the side matching the player color indicates researched technologies.

## Setup  
Each player chooses a role and gets the associated starting tiles.  Each role starts with a different number of colonies, fleets, resources, or technologies, as indicated on the role card.  

Set up your starting pieces in the designated starting zones, determined by the number of players.  Draw 1 of each resource.
Lay out the Technology cards around your role card, colored-side down.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Bidding

In this phase players bid their resources to claim exploration rights.  At the beginning of each round, each player draws and reveals a tile from the bag.
Each player secretly decides how many of each resource they are willing to pay, and holds those resource tokens in their hand.  All players reveal their bids simultaneously. 
Place your die with the amount bid face-up on the "Bid" section on the board. If multiple players bid the same amount, those players roll their die to break the tie. 
The player in the highest "Bid" slot chooses their placement in the turn order, and moves their die to the matching "Turn" section on the board. They then choose which tile they wish to place. If you choose an opponent's tile, you pay the next lowest bid to that player. If you choose your own tile, pay the next lowest bid to the bank. 
Place the tile on your role card. 

Turn order and tile selection continues to the next highest roll. The last player must take the remaining tile and remaining turn order spot. They do not pay any resources. (Note: if one or more players bid 0, additional players will end up paying 0 resources)
If there are not enough empty spaces left to explore, players will no longer draw tiles at the beginning of each round.  Bidding continues as before, but each player will pay the bank and choose only their turn order.

***Insert example here once I figure out wtf to say***

### Phase 2: Exploration & Actions  
At the beginning of your turn, place the tile you chose on an unexplored space.  Exploration must be done in the blue zone until there are 3 or fewer blue spaces left unexplored.  You may choose to place the tile with either side face up. If you place a destroyed planet tile, you may collect any resource from the bank.

Each turn, you may take 1 base action, 1 research action, and 1 additional action of your choice, in any order.  Place your action marker next to the action you take.  You make take duplicate actions.  Finalize all effects from an action before taking your next action. Some technologies cause slight changes in the base actions.

#### Base Actions

**_Build/Upgrade Colony_** - You may place a colony cube on a tile colonized by you, adjacent to another of your colonies, or on a tile occupied by your fleet.  The colony level is determined by the number of colony cubes on the tile.  You can only build up to a level 3 colony.  Cost: 1üçê+1üíé

**_Build Fleet_** - You may build a fleet on a colonized planet tile with a military symbol, up to the level of the colony.  If there is already a fleet on this tile, it is destroyed.

**_Upgrade Fleet_** - You may upgrade an existing fleet by 1 level, up to level 3, providing it is on a colonized planet tile with a military symbol.

**_Harvest_** - You may collect resources from every colonized planet tile with a resource symbol (1 card per colony level).  If there are multiple resource symbols, you may choose which resources to produce.

**_Move Fleet_** - You may move 1 fleet as many explored tiles as you can afford, up to 8 tiles.

Movement Cost:

|Fleet Level|Cost|Movement|
|---|---|---|
|1|1 ‚öõ|2 tiles|
|2|1 ‚öõ|1 tile|
|3|2 ‚öõ|1 tile|

You may not pass through destroyed planet tiles. You may pass through tiles occupied by your fleets, but cannot end the action there. You may not pass through a tile occupied by an opponent's fleet or colony (see attacking). Your fleets may occupy the same tile as your colony.

You may move your fleet into an unexplored space and draw 1 tile to immediately explore it without bidding.  This ends your move action. (Note: The outer spaces, indicated by the white zone, may be explored this way at any time. They are not restricted as during the bidding/exploration phases). If you place a destroyed planet tile, your fleet is immediately destroyed.

**_Attacking_** - 
On your move action, if your fleet enters a tile occupied by an opponent's fleet and/or colony, you attack.

To win an attack, you must have a higher offensive strength than your opponent's defensive strength (a tie goes to the defender). Fleet and colony strength is equal to their level, plus any modifiers gained from technology.
 
<img src="/images/Attack_Example.png" width="400px"/>
 
On a successful attack, you take over by replacing your opponent's colonies with yours. Their lost colonies go back into their supply. If a defensive fleet was on the attacked tile, it is destroyed and returned to their supply.

On a failed attack, your offensive fleet retreats, and is pushed back into the adjacent tile from where it came. If it cannot retreat into the adjacent tile (i.e., you moved it through an unexplored space using technology or by passing through a tile that is occupied by another one of your fleets), the attacking fleet is destroyed. 

**_Supporting_** - 
You may spend 1‚öõ to support per adjacent fleet. Supporting fleets add their level to your strength. You may support on your turn as part of the attack, or spend the required ‚öõ as defense if attacked. Supporting fleets do not move.

#### Research Actions  

**_Research_** - You may research a technology by paying the associated cost.  Effects from technologies researched may be used immediately.  When you purchase a technology, flip the card over.

The costs for each technology is indicated by the resource symbols at the bottom of each card. Technology costs marked with an asterisk indicate you may pay any resource.

Some technologies also require you to have researched a prerequisite technology. This is indicated on the unpurchased side of the card.

**_Use Technology_** - You may use any of the technologies signified with a üî¨.

**_Compile_** ‚Äì You may collect 1 resource of your choice from the bank. ‚ÄÉ

## Game End

The game end can be triggered one of two ways: 
When any player has fewer than 3 colonies remaining in their supply, or if any player has been eliminated (no colonies or fleets left on the board).  Once the game end has been triggered, complete the current round before scoring.  Note: once the game end has been triggered, it cannot be postponed by returning colonies to their supply or building new colonies or fleets.

**Scoring**

The player with the highest combined score wins. In the case of a tie, fight to the death to determine the actual winner (lasers are mandatory).



## *Ally Gameplay*

When playing with 4 or 6 players, you have the option to play with an ally against others.  Follow the base rules, with these variants:
Setup-
Set up your starting pieces in the designated starting zones, determined by the number of players.  You will each have a separate role and pieces.  

### Phase 1: Bidding

If you choose the tile you or your ally drew, pay the bank.

### Phase 2: Exploration

Each player chooses where to place the tile at the beginning of their turn, but may discuss placement with their ally.

### Phase 3: Actions

All actions must be made by the active player, and can only be made with the active player's resources, colonies, fleets, and technology, with a few exceptions:

You may build or upgrade your fleets on your ally's colonized planet tile with a military symbol. 

You may move a fleet through your ally's fleets and/or colonies, as if they were your own.  You may land on your ally's colonized planet tiles, as long as there is not already a fleet there.

You can only move your own fleets on your turn, and can only attack with your own fleets.  Ally fleets already in position may provide support during your attack.  Similarly, the player being attacked and their ally may provide support for defense.  Support costs remain the same, including the discount provided via Encryption.  The fleet on the tile being attacked still defends automatically for no cost, regardless of color.  Resolve the attack as usual.

At the end of your turn, if you and your ally are occupying the same planet tile (your fleet on their colony, for example), you may give your ally up to 3 resources.

**Scoring:**

Add the total score between allies and compare.  The pair with the highest combined score wins.  Resolve ties as usual.
