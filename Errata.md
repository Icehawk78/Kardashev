## Roles 

**Generalist**  

During setup, place a level 1 colony and a level 1 fleet.
Instead of 1 base, 1 research, and 1 action of your choice, you may take your 3 actions in any combination you choose.

**Imperialist**  

During setup, place a level 1 colony and 2 level 1 fleets.
When any player builds/upgrades a fleet, you may gain a resource of your choice. If this is on your turn, you must be able to afford the fleet before gaining this resource.

**Pioneer**  

During setup, place 2 level 1 colonies and a level 1 fleet.
When you build/upgrade a colony on a resource tile, you may gain a resource matching that of the tile. If you build/upgrade on a planet tile with multiple resource symbols, you may choose which resource you gain. You must be able to afford the colony before gaining this resource.

**Salvager**  

During setup, place a level 1 colony and a level 1 fleet.  You also draw 2 additional resource cards of your choice.
When you harvest, you may gain 1 bonus resource of your choice, matching 1 you are able to produce.

**Scientist**  

During setup, place a level 1 colony and a level 1 fleet.  You also select a level 1 technology.
When any player researches a technology, you may gain a resource matching 1 from the cost.  If you are researching the technology, you must be able to afford the cost before gaining this resource.

**Warlord**  

During setup, place a level 1 colony and a level 2 fleet.
Once per turn, when you move a fleet, you may gain resources matching the tiles of which you enter. You must be able to afford the move before gaining the resources. You may only gain a resource once per tile.

## Technology

**Fabricators**  *Your researchers have developed machines capable of constructing an entire spacecraft at the push of a button.*  
You may now choose to build or upgrade a fleet as your research action.  All other build/upgrade fleet rules apply.

**Autonomous Construction** *Your fabricators are advanced enough to construct entire fleets in zero-gravity.*  
You may build or upgrade a fleet on any uncolonized tile adjacent to one of your fleets.  This action costs 1 üíé  and 1 ‚öõ.  You may not build the fleet on a tile occupied by an opponent, or on a destroyed planet.  All other build/upgrade fleet rules apply.

**Militarization** *Military is the way of life.  Your citizens are all cross-trained to construct fleets when duty calls.*  
You may build/upgrade a fleet on any of your colonized planet tiles.  All other build/upgrade fleet rules apply.

**Interstellar Ark** *Your bravest citizens embark on space exploration in hopes of establishing new homes on yet undiscovered worlds.*  You may now choose to build or upgrade a colony as your research action.  All other build/upgrade colony rules and costs apply.

**Nanotube Polymers** *Your architects are adept at designing and constructing colonies, and can do so at half the cost.*  
When you build a level 1 colony, you may spend 1 üíé or 1 üçê, instead of 1 of each.

**Space Probe** *Your explorers have developed a device capable of mapping out deep space and assessing a planet's habitability.*  During your research action, you may draw and place a tile on any unexplored space (you are not restricted to the blue zone for this action).  You may choose to place the tile with either side face-up.  If you place a destroyed planet tile, you may collect any resource from the bank.  There is no bidding for exploration rights for this action.

**Magnetic Rake** *You have developed machinery capable of harvesting resources autonomously.*  
You may now choose to harvest as your research action.  All other harvest rules apply.

**Tractor Beam** *Your explorers are all trained to retrieve valuable resources from the planets they discover.  They can now retrieve them without landing.*  
Whenever you place a planet tile with a resource symbol, you may collect a matching resource.  This may be during an action on your turn or the Exploration Phase on anyone's turn.

**Arcology** *Your architects have the ability to construct self-sustaining habitats, allowing any structure you build to provide resources.*  
During your harvest action, you may name any resource type.  Treat all military symbols as this symbol for this action.  If you have a colony on a planet tile with a military and a resource symbol, you may collect either resource (or any combination of resources, if you have a higher level colony).

**Botsourcing** *Your researchers have produced robots capable of completing any action assigned to them, regardless of the complexity.*  
You may now choose to complete any base action as your research action.  You must pay any 1 resource of your choice to complete this action.  All other costs and rules for that action apply.

**Cloning** ***FLAVOR TEXT!!!***  
You may choose any technology you have on your role card to replace this technology.  This does not count as a prerequisite for higher level technologies in that line, nor does it provide the additional points for that technology.  Technology abilities do not stack or multiply.  You may use this to concurrently research mutually exclusive technologies.
   
**Memory Eraser** ***FLAVOR TEXT!!!*** 
You may name any technology on any role card.  All players who have researched this technology (including you), lose this technology and must remove their marker from it.  Each player who does so is refunded the cost (for technologies with variable costs, such as Encryption, you choose which resources are refunded).  If the technology is a prerequisite for a higher level technology, the higher levels are not affected.

**Propellant Depot** *You have stashed stores of fuel and supplies throughout space, allowing your fleets to continue to travel farther to discover additional worlds to conquer.*  
You may now choose to move a fleet as your research action.  All other move rules and costs apply. 

**Wormhole** ***FLAVOR TEXT!!!***  
During your move action, your fleet may skip over any single tile or unexplored space.  You may use this to jump over another player's occupied tile, a destroyed planet tile, or any other tile.  The skipped tile does not count as a tile for movement costs.  You may not collect a resource from the skipped tile from your special ability.
   
**Dyson Sphere** *You have the technology capable of harnessing the power of an entire star.*  
You do not need to spend ‚öõ to move your fleets.  All other move rules apply.  You must still pay ‚öõ to support with additional fleets during an attack.   

**Harvest Rover** *You have created machines capable of harvesting additional resources alongside your citizens.*  
When you harvest, if you have a fleet on a resource planet tile able to produce resources, you may harvest one additional resource.  All other harvest rules apply.

**Asteroid Mining** *You are able to remotely extract resources from uninhabited planets.*  
When you harvest, if you have a fleet on an uncolonized resource planet tile, you may harvest one matching resource.  All other harvest rules apply.

**Expanded Cargohold** *Fleets are now equipped with extra storage space, due to continued reduction of technology size requirements.*  
Instead of one resource collected via the harvest rover or asteroid mining, fleets now produce resources equal to their fleet level.  For example, a level 3 fleet on a tile with a level 3 colony will produce 6 resources when using harvest rover.  All other harvest rules apply.

**Encryption** *Your fleet captains can communicate with ease and secrecy, and are able to come to the aid of any citizen in need.*  
During an attack, one of your fleets may support without paying ‚öõ.  You may still pay ‚öõ to support with additional fleets.  This may be used for defensive or offensive supports.  All other attack and support rules apply.

**Terraform** *Your team is capable of modifying the atmosphere and surface of your planets to make them more habitable and productive.* 
You may add a new type to one of your colonized planet tiles.  You may add any of the 3 resource types by paying 1 matching resource, or add a military icon by paying any 1 resource.  You may terraform a tile with any level colony.  Place the corresponding terraform symbol on the chosen tile.  This symbol remains on the tile, even if your colony is defeated during an attack.

**Antimatter** *You have developed a weapon strong enough to obliterate any planet within range.*  
Choose an uncolonized planet tile, adjacent to a tile occupied by your fleet and/or colony.  Flip the tile over to diplay the destroyed planet side.  Collect all matching resources.

**Accretion Device** *Your scientists have developed a device capable of creating an entire habitable planet in the dead of space.*  
Choose a destroyed planet tile adjacent to a tile occupied by your fleet and/or colony.  Spend a resource and place the matching terraform marker on the tile. You may choose any resource to place the military symbol. 

**Fuel Efficiency** *You have developed engines with a clean burn, capable of consuming less fuel than before.*  
Your move action costs 1 less ‚öõ than it would typically take (no less than 0).  For example, if you were to move a level 1 fleet 4 tiles, pay 1 ‚öõ instead of 2 ‚öõ.  All other move rules apply. 

**Boosters** *Your shipbuilders have developed a technology capable of producing extreme speed.*  
When you move your fleet, you may move up to twice as far for no additional cost.  (Fuel efficiency will reduce this cost by 1‚öõ.)  All other move rules apply.

**Salvage Drone** *You have developed a drone capable of extracting resources from your target.  The drones are fragile, so be sure to distract their military.*  
When you fail an attack against an opponent's colony and are forced to retreat, your opponent must give you 3 resouces of their choice, from their supply.  This may be used in combination with other drone technology.

**Raider Drone** *You have developed advanced drones capable of precise, targeted extraction.*  
When you fail an attack against an opponent's colony and are forced to retreat, you may name a resource type.  Your opponent must give you all of his or her resources of that type.  This may be used in combination with other drone technology.

**Disrupter Drone** *Your military team has developed a weapone that leaves great destruction in your wake.*  
When you fail an attack against an opponent's colony and are forced to retreat, their colony is downgraded by one level.  If their colony was a level 1, it is destroyed.  You do not get to immediately place a colony.  This may be used in combination with other drone technology.

**Proximity Fuse** *You've prepared a nasty surprise to anyone who dares attack you.*  
If an opponent succeeds on an attack against you and takes over your colony, they must give you 1 resource of their choice from their supply.

**Defensive Turrets** *You have developed planet-to-space weapons, capable of targeting any fleet that tries attacking your colony.*  
If an opponent fails an attack against your colony and they are forced to retreat, their attacking fleet is downgraded by 1 level.  If it was a level 1 fleet, it is destroyed.  Supporting fleets are not affected.

**Orbital Defense Array** *You have built weaponry and positioned it in orbit around your planet.  It can be used to target your own planet, if neccessary to prevent an enemy from learning your secrets.*  
If an opponent succeeds on an attack against you and you lose your colony, their attacking fleet is downgraded by 1 level.  If it was a level 1 fleet, it is destroyed.  Supporting fleets are not affected.

**Taxation** *Your captains have discovered the efficiency of threatening your enemies, causing them to produce additional resources for your benefit.*  
When an opponent harvests on their turn, and you have a fleet on a tile adjacent to their produciing colony, you may gain a matching resource for each colony (a single fleet may be adjacent to multiple colonies, and could therefore collect multiple resources).  Your opponent may choose to not harvest from that colony, causing you not to collect.  You do not gain resources from any fleets that produce resources from other technologies.

**Blockade** *Any enemy within your range must abandon their other tasks and focus on their defense, for fear of total destruction.*  
Any players that have a colony on a planet tile adjacent to one of your fleets do not collect resources from those colonies when they harvest.  Your colonies' production is not affected.

**Timeshares** *Your military is so strong, your enemies will glady work for you in exchange for even a fleeting promise of safety.*  
On your harvest action, you may harvest from 1 colonized planet tile adjacent to each of your fleets, as if those colonies were your own.  You may not duplicate tiles if you have multiple adjacent fleets.  All other harvest rules apply.
